I used SKLearn modules in Jupyter Notebook to model and graph my experiments. 

The data can be found on my github or at:
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality
	-Had to remove the header line to get data to import correctly
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/dermatology
	-Removed instances with a '?' value for age

If you have base Ubuntu install you can get started with:
	-pip3 install scikit-learn
	-pip3 install jupyterlab
	-run "jupyer notebook" from command line
	-Open the notebook in the web browser at localhost:8888
