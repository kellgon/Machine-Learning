I used SKLearn modules in Jupyter Notebook to model and graph my experiments. 

The data can be found on my github or at:
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality
-Had to remove the header line to get data to import correctly

https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/dermatology
-Removed instances with a '?' value for age

If you have base Ubuntu install you can get started with:

-pip3 install scikit-learn
-pip3 install jupyterlab
-run "jupyer notebook" from command line
-Open the notebook in the web browser at localhost:8888
